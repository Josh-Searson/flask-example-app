# Principles of Effective RESTful API Design: Implementation in Flask
This repository contains two example Python projects that use the web framework Flask. 'flaskApp.py' builds a RESTful API that implements four basic HTTP requests: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. This is a basic application that involves the fundamentals of HTTP requests, RESTful APIs and Flask. The application can be tested by running 'test.py'.

The other project 'helloWorld.py' is a simple hello world application that is useful in showing the basics of setting up a Flask app.

These projects complement the article 'Principles of Effective RESTful API Design: Implementation in Flask' and can be used as an additional resource to help improve your understanding of the material.
